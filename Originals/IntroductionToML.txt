Machine Learning 
- Statistical Pattern recogintion 
- Algorithm ( called ML algo) Trained on set of data called training data 
- Once trained its called model 
- Model is then tested with new data called unseen data 
- Model intially gives wrong result 
- the loss (difference in actual output and expected output ) is fed 
to model to tweak it and correct its course 
- Model needs to be trained again and again to avoid 
outdated training data 
- Label target or y vairables ?? 
- Models are garbage in garbage out -> Training data quality is most important
- Different type of models 
    - Classification 
    - Predictive 
    - Cluster 
- Symbolic vs subsymbolic AI 
- Back propogation and neural networks 
- Transformers 
- KNN vs CNN ?? 

Supervise vs Unsupervise Learnings
