## üìö Comprehensive Guide: Local RAG Document Q\&A Bot

---

## üîé What You‚Äôre Building

You‚Äôll create a local Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application that:
‚úÖ Loads documents from your computer.
‚úÖ Splits them into small text chunks.
‚úÖ Embeds these chunks into a vector database.
‚úÖ Accepts user questions, embeds them, and retrieves the most relevant text chunks.
‚úÖ Builds a prompt by combining these chunks with your question.
‚úÖ Passes the prompt to a **local LLM running on your machine** (no cloud costs).
‚úÖ Shows the answer in a Streamlit-based web interface.

This is a **zero-cost setup** after initial install: perfect for learning, testing, and demos.

---

## üìÇ 0) Prerequisites

* Install Python 3.8 or later.
* Have basic terminal/command prompt knowledge.
* Know how to use `pip`.
* You‚Äôll need an internet connection once to install packages and models, but after that everything runs offline.

---

## üöÄ 1) Set up a Python environment

A virtual environment isolates your project‚Äôs dependencies so you don‚Äôt mess up other Python projects.

```bash
mkdir rag-demo
cd rag-demo
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

---

## üì¶ 2) Install required packages

This installs three critical tools:

* **chromadb**: lightweight local vector database.
* **sentence-transformers**: popular library for embeddings (semantic search).
* **streamlit**: quick way to create a web UI.

```bash
pip install chromadb sentence-transformers streamlit
```

---

## üìÑ 3) Prepare your documents

Create a folder called `docs/`:

```bash
mkdir docs
```

Place one or more `.txt` files inside `docs/`.
Example:

```
docs/
  guide.txt
  faq.txt
```

This is your **knowledge base**.

---

## üîé 4) Create embeddings & build vector database

You need a script that:

* Loads all `.txt` files.
* Splits each into smaller chunks (RAG works best on chunks of \~500 tokens or \~500-1000 characters).
* Embeds each chunk into a vector.
* Stores vectors in ChromaDB for fast similarity search later.

Create `build_index.py`:

```python
import os
import chromadb
from chromadb.utils import embedding_functions

# Connect to local Chroma instance (saves to disk automatically)
chroma_client = chromadb.Client()
collection = chroma_client.create_collection(name="docs")

# Load a free local embedding model
embedder = embedding_functions.SentenceTransformerEmbeddingFunction(model_name="all-MiniLM-L6-v2")

# Loop through your documents
for file_name in os.listdir("docs"):
    if not file_name.endswith(".txt"):
        continue

    with open(f"docs/{file_name}", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        text = f.read()

    # Simple chunking: split text into 500-character pieces
    chunks = [text[i:i+500] for i in range(0, len(text), 500)]

    # Add each chunk to Chroma with a unique ID
    for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks):
        collection.add(
            ids=[f"{file_name}_{i}"],
            documents=[chunk],
            embedding_function=embedder
        )

print("Index built successfully.")
```

Run it to build your knowledge base:

```bash
python build_index.py
```

---

## üìí Explanation: Embedding & Vector Database

* **Embedding** converts text into a numeric vector representing meaning.
* **Vector DB (Chroma)** stores these vectors so you can do fast **similarity search** later.
* When you ask a question, you embed the question, then search the DB for chunks with embeddings closest to your question.

---

## ü§ñ 5) Install and run a local LLM (Ollama)

Instead of cloud APIs, you‚Äôll use a **fully local LLM** via [Ollama](https://ollama.com/):

1. Download and install Ollama (macOS, Windows, Linux supported).
2. Pull a small LLM like Mistral:

```bash
ollama pull mistral
```

This will download the model so you don‚Äôt need the internet later.

3. Ollama runs a local HTTP API at `http://localhost:11434` by default, which you‚Äôll call from Python.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 6) Build a Streamlit app to interact with your RAG bot

Create `app.py`:

```python
import streamlit as st
import requests
import chromadb
from chromadb.utils import embedding_functions

# Connect to existing Chroma collection
chroma_client = chromadb.Client()
collection = chroma_client.get_collection(name="docs")

# Load same embedding model for the query
embedder = embedding_functions.SentenceTransformerEmbeddingFunction(model_name="all-MiniLM-L6-v2")

st.title("üìö Local RAG Document Q&A")

query = st.text_input("Ask a question about your documents:")

if query:
    # Embed the question
    query_embedding = embedder(query)
    # Retrieve top 3 most similar chunks
    results = collection.query(
        query_embeddings=[query_embedding],
        n_results=3
    )
    retrieved_texts = [doc for doc in results["documents"][0]]
    context = "\n\n".join(retrieved_texts)

    # Build a prompt for the LLM
    prompt = f"""You are a helpful assistant. Answer the question using the context below.

Context:
{context}

Question: {query}
Answer:"""

    # Call local LLM through Ollama
    response = requests.post(
        "http://localhost:11434/api/generate",
        json={
            "model": "mistral",
            "prompt": prompt,
            "stream": False
        }
    )
    answer = response.json()["response"]

    st.subheader("Answer:")
    st.write(answer)
```

---

## üèÉ 7) Run your app

Start Ollama in the background (if not already running):

```bash
ollama serve
```

Then, run your Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Open the local URL shown in your terminal (usually [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)), and start asking questions!

---

## ‚úÖ What Happens When You Ask a Question?

1Ô∏è‚É£ Your question is embedded with the same model used for the documents.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Chroma searches your knowledge base for the most relevant chunks (semantic similarity search).
3Ô∏è‚É£ These chunks are combined into a **context**.
4Ô∏è‚É£ A prompt is built: context + question ‚Üí instruction for the LLM.
5Ô∏è‚É£ The local LLM generates an answer.
6Ô∏è‚É£ Answer is displayed on the web interface.

This completes the **retrieval-augmented generation loop** entirely offline.

---

## üîß How to Extend

* **Add more docs**: drop more files into `docs/`, rerun `build_index.py`.
* **Change embedding model**: try larger or multilingual models in `sentence-transformers`.
* **Use better chunking**: instead of fixed sizes, you could split on sentences or paragraphs with overlap.
* **Improve UI**: add document upload, history, or multi-user support.
* **Test other local LLMs**: Ollama supports Mixtral, LLaMA, Gemma, etc. Swap the `model` parameter.
* **Move to production**: swap Ollama for cloud LLMs when you‚Äôre ready to deploy (LangChain and LlamaIndex integrate easily).

---

## üö® Tips & Common Issues

* Always use **the same embedding model** for indexing and querying.
* Ollama must be running; otherwise you‚Äôll get a connection error when generating answers.
* If you update documents, rerun `build_index.py` to refresh the knowledge base.
* Local LLM performance depends on your CPU/GPU; smaller models run faster on CPUs.

---

## üí° Why This Matters

This workflow mirrors real-world RAG systems in production (e.g., chatbots, internal Q\&A systems) but without cost barriers. By building this:

* You learn embeddings, vector databases, and prompt engineering.
* You understand the core of modern AI-powered search/chat systems.
* You can demo a working RAG application entirely offline.
