## ü§ñ AI Learning Notes: Generative vs Discriminative Models & Probabilistic vs Deterministic Nature

### üîπ 1. Discriminative Models

- **Purpose:** Learn to *separate* or *classify* data.
- **What they learn:**
    
    P(y‚à£x)P(y \mid x)
    
    (Probability of label `y` given input `x`)
    
- **Use case:** Direct classification.
- **Examples:** Logistic Regression, SVM, Neural Networks.
- **Behavior:** Usually **deterministic** (same input ‚Üí same output).
- **Key Feature:** Don't try to understand how data is *generated*.

---

### üîπ 2. Generative Models

- **Purpose:** Learn how data is *generated* for each class.
- **What they learn:**
    
    P(x,y)=P(x‚à£y)‚ãÖP(y)P(x, y) = P(x \mid y) \cdot P(y)
    
    (Joint distribution of input and label)
    
- **Use case:** Classification **and** generating new data.
- **Examples:** Naive Bayes, GANs, VAEs, HMMs.
- **Behavior:** Usually **probabilistic** (output includes randomness or uncertainty).
- **Key Feature:** Can simulate/produce new data samples.

---

### üîπ 3. Deterministic Models

- **Output:** Always the same result for the same input.
- **Pros:** Simple, predictable.
- **Cons:** Can‚Äôt express uncertainty.
- **Examples:** SVM, Classic Neural Nets (inference), Decision Trees.

---

### üîπ 4. Probabilistic Models

- **Output:** Probabilities or distributions instead of fixed values.
- **Pros:** Express uncertainty, handle missing data, can generate new data.
- **Cons:** More complex and may include randomness.
- **Examples:** Naive Bayes, GMM, Bayesian Networks, Softmax output in classifiers.

    ```
    
- ‚úÖ **Pros:** Helps model generalize from patterns
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Cons:** Token-expensive, limited by input length

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**

- **What:** Ask the model to **show its reasoning step-by-step** before giving the final answer.
- **When to use:** For logical, arithmetic, or multi-step reasoning.
- üîπ Example:
    
    `"If there are 3 apples and you eat 1, how many are left? Let's think step by step."`
    
- ‚úÖ **Pros:** Boosts reasoning accuracy
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Cons:** Slower, longer responses

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Augmented Knowledge Prompting**

## üß† Prompting in LLMs

### ‚úÖ What is Prompting?

- **Prompting** is the method of giving instructions or data to a language model to get the desired output.
- It's how we **"program"** an LLM *without writing code*, just through natural language.

---

## üîπ Basic Prompting Techniques

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Direct Prompting**

- Just ask what you want.
- üîπ Example:
    
    `"Summarize this paragraph."`
    

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Instruction Prompting**

- Give clear, explicit instructions.
- üîπ Example:

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting**

- Ask the model to think **step by step** before answering.
- Great for math, logic, or multi-step reasoning.

---

## üß† Even More Advanced Techniques

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Self-Consistency**

- Instead of one answer, the model generates **multiple reasoning paths**.
- The final answer is selected based on the most consistent outcome.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **ReAct (Reason + Act) Prompting**

- Combines **reasoning** with **external actions** (e.g., search, tools).
- Common in agents or systems that interact with APIs, databases, or the web.
- Example:
    
    `"Search for the population of Japan, then compare it to Germany."`
    

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Tree-of-Thought (ToT) Prompting**

- Like CoT, but explores **multiple reasoning branches**, not just one.
- Allows "backtracking" and better problem-solving in complex reasoning.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**

- Model uses **external knowledge** fetched via search or embedding retrieval.
- Keeps responses factual and updated.
- Often used in chatbots, enterprise apps, etc.

## üîÑ Variational Autoencoder (VAE)

### üîπ What is a VAE?

A **Variational Autoencoder** is a type of generative model that learns to represent data in a **compressed latent space** and can **generate new data** similar to the input.

---

### üß† Core Idea

- VAEs are **autoencoders** with a probabilistic twist:
    - Instead of encoding input to a fixed vector ‚Üí encode to a **distribution** (mean & variance).
    - Sample from that distribution to decode and reconstruct or generate new data.

---

## üèóÔ∏è VAE Architecture

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Encoder**

- Maps input `x` to two vectors:
    - **Œº (mu)** = mean
    - **œÉ¬≤ (sigma¬≤)** = variance
- These define a normal distribution N(Œº,œÉ2)\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Latent Space Sampling**

- Sample **z** from N(Œº,œÉ2)\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)
    
    (use **reparameterization trick** for backpropagation)
    

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Decoder**

- Reconstructs the input from `z`:
    
    x^=Decoder(z)\hat{x} = Decoder(z)
    

---

## üéØ Loss Function

VAE loss =

### üî∏ **Reconstruction Loss**

- How close is x^\hat{x} to the original input `x`

### üî∏ **KL Divergence Loss**

- Encourages latent space to follow a **standard normal distribution**
- Helps in smooth interpolation and generation

Loss=Eq(z‚à£x)[log‚Å°p(x‚à£z)]‚àíDKL(q(z‚à£x)‚à£‚à£p(z))\text{Loss} = \mathbb{E}_{q(z|x)}[\log p(x|z)] - D_{KL}(q(z|x) || p(z))

---

## üîÑ Why Use VAEs?

| Benefit | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Generative** | Can generate new samples (e.g., images) |
| **Smooth Latent Space** | Similar inputs ‚Üí close latent points |
| **Structured** | Can be controlled/interpreted |
| **Efficient** | Trains with backprop; no sampling instability (unlike GANs) |

---

## üß™ Common Use Cases

- Image generation (e.g., MNIST, faces)
- Anomaly detection
- Representation learning
- Text and music generation (with variants like VAE-LSTM)Here are your notes on different types of **Transformers** in AI/ML ‚Äì written simply and cleanly for your future reference:

---

---

### üß† **What are Transformers?**

- **Definition**: A deep learning architecture introduced in 2017 (paper: *"Attention is All You Need"*) that processes input data in parallel and uses **self-attention** to understand relationships in sequences.
- **Purpose**: Originally built for NLP tasks like translation, summarization, and text generation.
- **Key Components**:
    - **Encoder**: Reads and processes the input.
    - **Decoder**: Produces the output (used in some tasks like translation).
    - **Self-Attention**: Helps model focus on relevant parts of input while processing.
- **Advantage**: Unlike RNNs, transformers process all data **simultaneously** (not step-by-step), making them faster and more scalable.

---

### üîÑ **What are Auto-Encoded Transformers?**

- **Definition**: Transformers used in **encoder-only** mode.
- **Goal**: Understand and extract meaningful representations from input data.
- **Common Use**: Classification, embeddings, and feature extraction.
- **Example Model**: **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**
- **Working**: Reads the entire sentence (both directions) and learns context around each word.

---

### üßæ **What are Auto-Regressive Transformers?**

- **Definition**: Transformers used in **decoder-only** mode.
- **Goal**: Predict next word/token based on previous ones (left-to-right).
- **Common Use**: Text generation, language modeling.
- **Example Models**: **GPT family (GPT-2, GPT-3, GPT-4)**
- **Working**: Predicts one word at a time using previously generated words, like autocomplete on steroids.

---

### üîÅ **What are Sequence-to-Sequence Transformers?**

- **Definition**: Full transformer architecture with both **encoder and decoder**.
- **Goal**: Convert one sequence to another (e.g., English to French).
- **Common Use**: Machine translation, summarization, question answering.
- **Example Models**: **T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer), BART**
- **Working**:
    - Encoder understands input (e.g., a sentence).
    - Decoder generates the output (e.g., translated sentence).

---

---

### üß≤ **What is Self-Attention Mechanism?**

- **Definition**: A technique used in transformers to help the model focus on **important parts of the input sequence**, even if they‚Äôre far apart.
- **Why It Matters**: It allows the model to **understand context**, like the relationship between words in a sentence, regardless of their position.

---

### üîç **How It Works (Intuitively)**

- Each word looks at **all other words** in the sentence (including itself) to decide **how much attention** to pay to each.
- The model assigns **attention scores** to weigh the importance of other words when processing a word.
    - Example: In ‚ÄúThe cat sat on the mat,‚Äù when processing ‚Äúsat,‚Äù the model might pay more attention to ‚Äúcat.‚Äù

---

### üì¶ **Core Components (Simplified)**

1. **Query (Q)** ‚Äì Represents the current word (What am I looking for?)
2. **Key (K)** ‚Äì Represents other words (What info do others offer?)
3. **Value (V)** ‚Äì The actual data to pull from each word (What to use if important)

‚Üí The model compares Q with all Ks ‚Üí gets attention scores ‚Üí uses them to weigh Vs ‚Üí final output is a **weighted sum**.

---

### üß† **Benefits**

- Handles **long-range dependencies** well (e.g., connection between beginning and end of a sentence).
- Works in **parallel** (faster than RNNs/LSTMs).
- Core to understanding context in **transformer-based models** like BERT, GPT, etc.

---

### ‚úåÔ∏è **Few-Shot Learning**

- **Definition**: The model is given a **few examples** (2‚Äì5 typically) in the prompt before performing the actual task.
- **Goal**: Help the model understand the **pattern** from minimal guidance.

---

### üß† **How It Works**

- Examples are included in the prompt to teach the model the format or logic:
    
    > Example 1:
    > 
    > 
    > Input: ‚ÄúI love this place!‚Äù ‚Üí Sentiment: Positive
    > 
    > Example 2:
    > 
    > Input: ‚ÄúThe food was terrible.‚Äù ‚Üí Sentiment: Negative
    > 
    > New Input: ‚ÄúAmazing experience!‚Äù ‚Üí Sentiment: ?
    > 

‚Üí The model picks up the pattern and applies it to the new input.

---

### üßæ **Use Cases**

- Text classification
- Translation
- Summarization
- Math and logic questions

---

### üß† **Why It Works**

- Models like GPT are trained on huge text corpora, so a few examples help them **infer the task** even if it wasn‚Äôt part of their original training.

---

### üîó **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting**

- **Definition**: A technique where the model is encouraged to **think step-by-step** by showing intermediate reasoning in the prompt.
- **Goal**: Improve reasoning for complex tasks like math, logic, or common sense problems.

---

### üß† **How It Works**

> Q: If I have 3 apples and buy 2 more, how many apples do I have?
> 
> 
> A: First, I had 3 apples. Then I bought 2 more. So, 3 + 2 = 5.
> 
> Final Answer: 5
> 

‚Üí CoT makes the model **slow down** and ‚Äúthink aloud,‚Äù leading to better accuracy.

---

### üöÄ **Why It Helps**

- Improves performance on:
    - Math word problems
    - Multi-step reasoning
    - Logical inference tasks

---

### üìö **Augmented Knowledge Prompting**

- **Definition**: A technique where a prompt is enhanced using **external information or tools** before being passed to the model.
- **Goal**: Help the model **reason better** or **answer accurately** by giving it access to **relevant context** it doesn‚Äôt know natively.

---

### üß† **How It Works**

1. **Retrieve** additional info (e.g., from a database, search engine, or document).
2. **Combine** this info with the original user query.
3. **Prompt** the model with the enriched context.

---

### üì¶ **Example**

> Query: ‚ÄúWhat is the latest population of India?‚Äù
> 
> 
> Step 1: System fetches latest number from a data source
> 
> Step 2: Prompt becomes:
> 
> ‚ÄúAccording to the UN 2024 report, India‚Äôs population is 1.43 billion. What are the implications of this growth?‚Äù
> 

‚Üí The model uses this **retrieved data** to provide a more **grounded** and **factual** response.

---

### üîß **Techniques Often Used**

- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Combines retrieval + LLM.
- **Tools & Plugins**: External APIs (e.g., calculator, search).
- **Embedding Search**: Vector-based matching from documents.

---

### ü§ñ **Why It‚Äôs Useful**

- Reduces hallucination.
- Keeps answers **up-to-date** (e.g., recent news, data).
- Makes LLMs better at **domain-specific** tasks (e.g., medical, legal).

---

### üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Masked Language Model (MLM)**

- **Definition**: A type of model trained to **predict missing (masked) words** in a sentence.
- **Goal**: Learn the context of words by trying to guess the masked parts using surrounding words.

---

### üß† **How It Works**

- During training, random words in a sentence are **replaced with a [MASK] token**.
- The model tries to **predict the masked word** based on the rest of the sentence.

> Example:
> 
> 
> Input: ‚ÄúThe cat sat on the [MASK].‚Äù
> 
> Model Prediction: ‚Äúmat‚Äù
> 
- The model learns **bidirectional context** (it looks at both left and right sides).

---

### üß™ **Used In**

- **BERT** (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is the most famous MLM.
- Works well for **classification**, **named entity recognition**, **sentence embedding**, etc.

---

### üîÑ **Difference from Autoregressive Models**

- **MLM**: Predicts masked word using the **entire context** (left + right).
- **Autoregressive**: Predicts next word using **only previous words** (left-to-right).

---

### üìö **Benefits**

- Deep understanding of context.
- Suitable for tasks where complete input is available (e.g., text classification, QA).

---

Let me know if you'd like a comparison chart between MLM and other types like autoregressive or encoder-decoder models!

---

### üß† **Self-Attention vs. Self-Supervision**

---

### üîÑ **Self-Attention**

- **Definition**: A **mechanism inside transformer models** that lets each token in a sequence **focus on other tokens** to understand context.
- **Purpose**: To help the model figure out which parts of the input are relevant to each word.
- **Used In**: Transformers (BERT, GPT, etc.)

> üìå Think of it as ‚Äúhow words look at each other‚Äù to understand meaning.
> 
- **Example**:
    
    In ‚ÄúThe bank will close at 5,‚Äù
    
    - ‚Äúbank‚Äù looks at ‚Äúclose‚Äù to decide whether it refers to a riverbank or a financial bank.

---

### ü§ñ **Self-Supervision**

- **Definition**: A **training strategy** where the model learns patterns **without labeled data**.
- **Purpose**: To train models using the data itself as a source of supervision.
- **Used In**: Pretraining of large models like BERT, GPT, CLIP.

> üìå Think of it as ‚Äúlearning by predicting parts of data from itself.‚Äù
> 
- **Example**:
    - Predict missing words (**Masked Language Modeling**).
    - Predict next token (**Autoregressive models**).
    - Predict future video frame or image patch.

---

### üßæ **Quick Comparison Table**

| Aspect | Self-Attention | Self-Supervision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Type | Model mechanism | Training technique |
| Purpose | Understand relationships in data | Learn from unlabeled data |
| Found In | Inside Transformer models | In pretraining stage of many models |
| Example | Focus on ‚Äúmat‚Äù when reading ‚Äúcat‚Äù | Predict masked words in a sentence |

# Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) of GPT Models

**What is SFT?**

Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is the process of training a pre-trained GPT model on a curated dataset where inputs and expected outputs are explicitly provided. Instead of learning from scratch, the model refines its behavior by mimicking the "correct" responses given in the fine-tuning dataset.

**How it works:**

- You start with a base model (e.g., GPT-3, GPT-4).
- Prepare a labeled dataset: `(prompt, desired output)` pairs.
- Fine-tune the model using supervised learning: adjusting weights to minimize the loss between the model's outputs and the provided desired outputs.

---

# Why Do We Need SFT?

- **Specialization:**
    
    Pretrained GPT models are generalists. SFT helps specialize them for **specific tasks** (e.g., customer support, legal document drafting, medical Q&A).
    
- **Alignment:**
    
    Helps align the model to **organizational or ethical standards**, ensuring it behaves predictably in a given context.
    
- **Improving Accuracy:**
    
    Fine-tuning can significantly improve model accuracy on domain-specific tasks where base models might otherwise perform poorly.
    
- **Safety and Control:**
    
    Reduces hallucinations or unsafe outputs in sensitive applications (e.g., finance, healthcare).
    

---

# Other Methods Besides SFT

| Method | Description | Example Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Prompt Engineering** | Carefully crafting the input prompt to steer behavior without changing model weights | No-code, fastest way to adapt behavior |
| **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** | Injects small trainable layers; cheaper and faster than full SFT | Personalizing models without huge compute |
| **RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback)** | Model improves outputs by learning from human preferences, not fixed answers | Used in ChatGPT (post-SFT) to make responses more helpful and polite |
| **Adapters** | Lightweight modules inserted between model layers | Specialization without touching core model weights |

---

# Real-World Examples

- **OpenAI's ChatGPT:**
    
    Initially trained using SFT on conversations where the desired assistant behavior was manually curated.
    
- **GitHub Copilot (based on Codex):**
    
    Fine-tuned with supervised datasets of `(natural language description ‚Üí code)` pairs.
    
- **Customer Support Bots:**
    
    Enterprises fine-tune LLMs on thousands of real support ticket interactions to create agents that handle domain-specific queries accurately.
    
- **Medical LLMs (e.g., MedPaLM):**
    
    Fine-tuned using verified medical Q&A datasets to ensure safe and knowledgeable health-related responses.

    The model learns from a **labeled dataset** where each input has a corresponding correct output.
    
- **Goal:**
    
    Predict the correct output (label) for new inputs.
    
- **Example:**
    - Spam detection: Emails are labeled as "spam" or "not spam."
    - Image classification: Photos labeled as "cat," "dog," etc.

---

### 2. Unsupervised Learning

- **Definition:**
    
    The model learns patterns **without labeled outputs**. It tries to find hidden structures in the data.
    
- **Goal:**
    
    Discover grouping, similarities, or underlying patterns.
    
- **Example:**
    - Customer segmentation: Grouping customers into clusters based on buying behavior.
    - Anomaly detection: Identifying unusual patterns without prior labels.

---

### 3. Self-Supervised Learning

- **Definition:**
    
    A middle ground where the model **generates its own labels** from the input data.
    
    It **learns by predicting parts of the data from other parts**, without needing external human labeling.
    
- **Goal:**
    
    Learn useful representations that can later be used for downstream tasks.
    
- **Example:**
    - GPT Pretraining: Predicting the next word in a sentence (e.g., "The cat sat on the ___") using the sentence itself as supervision.
    - Vision models: Predicting missing parts of an image or rotation angles.

# Transformer Architecture ‚Äì Short Notes

### 1. Overview

- **Introduced by:** Vaswani et al. in the 2017 paper *‚ÄúAttention is All You Need.‚Äù*
- **Purpose:** Designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., translation, summarization).
- **Key Innovation:** Replaces RNNs/LSTMs with **self-attention** mechanisms for better parallelism and long-range dependency modeling.

---

### 2. High-Level Structure

### üîπ Encoder-Decoder Architecture

- **Encoder:** Converts input sequence into context-rich representations.
- **Decoder:** Uses encoder output + previously generated tokens to predict the next token.

---

### 3. Core Components

| Component | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Input Embeddings** | Converts tokens to dense vectors + adds **positional encoding** (since no recurrence) |
| **Self-Attention** | Each token attends to all others in the sequence to capture relationships |
| **Multi-Head Attention** | Multiple attention layers run in parallel to learn different aspects of relationships |
| **Feed-Forward Network (FFN)** | Fully connected layers applied to each token separately |
| **Layer Norm + Residual Connections** | Added after attention and FFN to stabilize training |
| **Positional Encoding** | Injects information about token order since transformer has no recurrence or convolution |

---

### 4. Transformer Block (Per Layer)

**For Encoder (stacked N times):**

```
Input ‚Üí [Multi-Head Attention] ‚Üí Add & Norm ‚Üí [FFN] ‚Üí Add & Norm ‚Üí Output

```

**For Decoder (stacked N times):**

```
Input ‚Üí [Masked Multi-Head Attention] ‚Üí Add & Norm
      ‚Üí [Encoder-Decoder Attention] ‚Üí Add & Norm
      ‚Üí [FFN] ‚Üí Add & Norm ‚Üí Output

```

### 5. Why It Works Well

- **Parallelizable:** Unlike RNNs, can process all tokens at once.
- **Scales with Data:** Works well with large datasets and model sizes.
- **Captures Long-Range Dependencies:** Attention lets each token see all others directly.

# Foundation Models ‚Äì Short Notes

### 1. Definition

- **Foundation models** are large-scale **pretrained models** (usually using self-supervised learning) that serve as a **general-purpose base** for a wide variety of downstream tasks.
- The term was popularized by Stanford‚Äôs **CRFM (Center for Research on Foundation Models)**.

---

### 2. Key Characteristics

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Pretrained at scale** | Trained on massive datasets (text, code, images, etc.) |
| **General-purpose** | Can be adapted (fine-tuned or prompted) for many tasks |
| **Transferable** | Serve as the base for specific applications: translation, coding, Q&A, etc. |
| **Modality-agnostic** | Not limited to text; includes image (CLIP, DALL¬∑E), audio, video, and multimodal models |

---

### 3. Examples

| Model | Modality | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **GPT-4** | Text | Chatbots, summarization, coding |
| **BERT** | Text | Classification, NER, Q&A |
| **CLIP** | Text + Image | Image-text alignment |
| **DALL¬∑E** | Image | Text-to-image generation |
| **SAM (Segment Anything)** | Vision | Object segmentation |

---

### 4. Why Important?

- **Efficiency:** One model can power many applications, reducing the need to build from scratch.
- **Performance:** Outperforms task-specific models when scaled.
- **Ecosystem:** Enables new workflows (e.g., prompt engineering, few-shot learning).

---

### 5. Risks and Considerations

- **Bias & Fairness:** Foundation models may amplify social biases from training data.
- **Compute & Cost:** Very expensive to train and maintain.
- **Opacity:** Often behave like black boxes; hard to interpret or explain.

# Scaling LLMs & Emergence ‚Äì Short Notes

### 1. What Is Scaling in LLMs?

- **Scaling** refers to systematically increasing the **model size**, **dataset size**, and **compute** during training.
- Key finding: **Performance improves predictably** (on average) as you scale up parameters, data, and training steps.

---

### 2. Scaling Laws

- Discovered by OpenAI and DeepMind.
- Empirically observed that **loss (error)** decreases smoothly as a power-law with respect to:
    - **Model size (parameters)**
    - **Dataset size (tokens)**
    - **Compute used (FLOPs)**
- Helps **forecast** how large a model should be to achieve a given performance target.

---

### 3. Emergence in LLMs

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Emergence** | Sudden appearance of **qualitatively new capabilities** once a model crosses a certain scale |
| **Not linear** | Some abilities don‚Äôt appear gradually‚Äîthey emerge **abruptly** at scale |
| **Examples** | - In-context learning |

```
            - Multi-step reasoning
            - Code generation
            - Chain-of-thought logic
            - Tool use & planning |

```

---

### 4. Real Examples of Emergent Abilities

| Model Scale | Emergent Capability |
| --- | --- |
| ~10B params | Few-shot learning starts to emerge |
| ~100B+ | Complex reasoning, translation, tool use |
| GPT-4 (multi-modal) | Vision + text reasoning, agents, tool execution |

---

### 5. Implications of Emergence

- **Unpredictable behaviors**: Abilities not directly programmed arise.
- **Powerful generalization**: Can solve tasks never seen in training.
- **Safety risks**: Difficult to anticipate failure modes or biases.
- **Tool use potential**: Larger models can be instructed to interact with tools, memory, or APIs.

---

### 6. Conclusion

- **Scaling is not just more data or parameters** ‚Äî it unlocks **new behaviors**.
- The challenge now is **alignment, efficiency**, and **controlled deployment** of these powerful emergent capabilities.
